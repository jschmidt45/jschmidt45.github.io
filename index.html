  <h1>Computer Science Capstone</h1>
</header>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Hello! My name is John Schmidt, and I began attending SNHU for a degree in computer science about two and a half years ago. In this course, CS-499, the core objective was to demonstrate our
  growth by improving older projects that we had created in previous classes while learning more about the software engineering field. The goal of these improvements is to showcase our 
  abilities in three key areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. In this self-assessment, I will explain my selection of artifacts, the improvements
  that I made to them, the other steps along the way, and what I have learned beyond the artifacts from my programs at SNHU.
</p>
</br>
<h2>Artifact Selection and Improvement Plan</h2>
<p>
  The first step of this process was to select artifacts that we would improve to showcase our abilities in the three areas described above. I chose to use two straightforward assignments from a 
  previous course. 
</p>
</br>
<h3>Task Service</h3>
<p>
  The first assignment I chose was called TaskService. It is a Java project that allows users to create a task object with parameters such as description and name. I selected this artifact to demonstrate
  my growth and ability regarding data structures and algorithms. The original data structure that held the tasks was a hash map, and while that worked well for simply storing the tasks, hash maps
  do not have the ability to sort their contents. For myself, if I were using a program that allowed me to store and see tasks, I would want the ability to sort and view them based on metrics such 
  as priority and deadline. So, my planned improvement for this artifact was to first update the task object to include date and priority parameters and then implement tree maps, which would 
  automatically sort them based on these parameters. That way, the program could return tasks sorted by the selected parameter. You can see the original artifact below.

</ul>
</br>
<h3>Appointment Service</h3>
<p>
  The second assignment that I chose was called AppointmentService. Like TaskService, AppointmentService was a simple Java program that allowed users to create an appointment with the parameters of ID, date, and description. 
  My idea for this project was to integrate it with a functional frontend and database to create an entire application, with the original AppointmentService being the basis for my backend code. With this artifact, I planned
  on demonstrating my growth in both software engineering and design, as well as databases. My planned improvement was to create a frontend using React that had a login page, a signup page, and the overall appointments page.
  I then planned to implement a MySQL database to store the information for users and appointments. Then, I would integrate Spring Boot to transform the AppointmentService Java file into a RESTful API that would allow my frontend
  to interact with the database.

<h2>Code Review</h2>
<p>
  Following the selection of our artifacts, our next assignment was to complete a thorough code review. In this code review, I talk about the original artifact code and cover topics such as functionality, best practices, format,
  and potential areas for improvement. Following this, I outlined the ideas that I had for the code improvement that I described above while referencing the original code. You can find this video below.

<h2>Enhancement One</h2>
<p>
  For the first enhancement, our task was to improve on our artifact in a way that demonstrated software engineering and design. For this enhancement, I created my React frontend portion of the application. The fronted consisted of a login, 
  sign up, and appointment page. I also integrated the MySQL database to hold information about the appointments, but I had not set it up to hold user information for this enhancement. So at this point, the application still had hardcoded
  login information and the sign up page was not functional yet. I also had incorporated Spring Boot to turn my existing Java code into a RESTful API. I had to alter many aspects of the original code to make this succesfull. However, the 
  main logic of the original AppointmentService was still the basis of my backend code. Attached below is my narrative for enhacement one. My code for the overall project will be included below with enhancement three.
</p>

</ul>
</br>
<h2>Enhancement Two</h2>
<p>
  For this enhancement, our task was to improve on an artifact to demonstrate our ability in algorithims and data structures. To do this, I implemented a tree map which replaced the initial hash map that was used in the original Java project.
  By doing this, I was able to sort the task entries as they were added and return lists sorted by either deadline or priority. This resulted in an application that would be much more usable as a task tracking service, since tasks would not just 
  be displayed based on when they were entered, but instead on a parameter such as deadline or priority.

</ul>
<h2>Enhancement Three</h2>
<p>
  For the final enhancement, we were to improve an artifact to demonstrate our ability in databases. To accomplish this, I further improved upon my initial AppointmentService enhancement by altering my API and database to store User data. Following this, 
  I implemented login and sign up functionality. Then, I made it so that only appointments that belong to a specific user could be seen, updated, and deleted. At this point, the general functionality of the application was complete. There are still some 
  additional features that could be implemented to further enhance the final product such as more unit tests and additional security functionality, but the final code does include security features such as hashing and input validation. This enhacement was
  the final milestone that was completed for the course.

<h2>Reflection and Self-Assessment</h2>
<p>
  This capstone course and my other classes throughout my time at SNHU have played a crucial role in shaping my skills as a software developer and preparing me for a career in the computer science field. This program has helped me develop a strong 
  background in areas such as software engineering, software design, database management, data structures, algorithms, security, and collaboration. By building my ePortfolio, I have been able to showcase my strengths, growth, and ability to solve problems that 
  are directly applicable to the software development field.
</p>
</br>
<p>
  From my coursework, I have learned a lot about agile development and team communication that shape how an application is planned and designed. In many instances, we have had to take information given to us by stakeholders and potential users and interpret 
  that information in order to create an application that would fit the needs of its customer base while not exceeding the constraints placed on the product itself. We have learned how the many moving pieces of an agile team all contribute to the development 
  of a final product. Because of these lessons, I have learned how crucial effective collaboration and teamwork are when building a software product.
</p>
</br>
<p>
  This program has also helped me gain experience in software design, security, databases, and algorithms. These key concepts in coding were emphasized in each course as we continued to build on each foundational concept. In every project or milestone that we 
  completed, we further expanded on one or more of these crucial areas. This has allowed me to build a solid foundation in each of these core coding practices. Because of this, I have learned how to create applications that integrate various frameworks and databases 
  while protecting user data and using data structures and algorithms that are efficient and perform the required functionality of the application. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
  Overall, my coursework and ePortfolio have helped me obtain the necessary skills to be prepared to enter the software development field with confidence. By using my technical skills and ability to problem solve, I hope to use what I have learned throughout 
  this program to become a successful software developer following graduation. I believe that my coursework, internship, and projects have prepared me to step into the computer science field with a solid foundation and the skills to contribute meaningfully to any team 
  that I would be a part of.
