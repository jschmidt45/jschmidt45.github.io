  <h1>Computer Science Capstone</h1>
</header>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Hello! My name is John Schmidt and I began attending SNHU for a degree in computer science about two and a half years ago. In this course, CS-499, the core objective was to demonstrate our
  growth by improving on older projects that we had created in previous classes while learning more about the software engineering field. The goal of these improvements are to showcase our 
  abilities in three key areas; software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. In this self-assessment, I will explain my selection of artifacts, the improvements
  that I made to them, the other steps along the way, and what I have learned beyond the artifacts from my programs at SNHU.
</p>
</br>
<h2>Artifact Selection and Improvement Plan</h2>
<p>
  The first step of this process was to select artifacts that we would improve to showcase our abilities in the three areas described above. I chose to use two straightforward assignments from a 
  previous course. 
</p>
</br>
<h3>Task Service</h3>
<p>
  The first assignment I chose was called TaskService. It is a Java project that allows users to create a task object with parameters such as description and name. I selected this artifact to demonstrate
  my growth and ability regarding data structures and algorithms. The original data structure that held the tasks was a hash map and while that worked well for simply storing the tasks, hash maps
  do not have the ability to sort their contents. For myself, if I was using a program that allowed me to store and see tasks, I would want the ability to sort and view them based on metrics such 
  as priority and deadline. So, my planned improvement for this artifact was to first update the task object to include date and priority parameters, and then implement tree maps, which would 
  automatically sort them based on these parameters. That way, the program could return tasks sorted by the parameter selected. You can see the original artifact below.

</ul>

<h3>Appointment Service</h3>
<p>
  The second assigment that I chose was called AppointmentService. Like TaskService, AppointmentService was a simple Java program that allowed users to create an appoinment with the parameters of ID, date, and description. 
  My idea for this project was to integrate it with a functional frontend and database to create an entire application with the original AppointmentServive being the basis for my backend code. With this artifact, I planned
  on demonstrating my growth in both software engineering and design, as well as databases. My planned improvement was to create a frontend using React that had a login page, a signup page, and the overall appointments page.
  I then planned to implement a MySQL database to store the information for users and appointments. Then, I would integrate Spring Boot to tranform the AppointmentService java file into a RESTful API that would allow my frontend
  to interact with the database.

<h2>Code Review</h2>
<p>
  Following the selection of our artifacts, our next assignment was to complete a thorough code reivew. In this code review, I talk about the original artifact code and cover topics such as functionality, best practices, format,
  and potential areas for improvement. Following this, I outlined the ideas that I had for the code improvement that I described above while referencing the original code. You can find this video below.

<h2>Enhancement One</h2>
<p>
  For the first enhancement, our task was to improve on our artifcat in a way the demonstrated software engineering and design. For this enhancement, I created my React frontend portion of the application. The fronted consisted of a login, 
  sign up, and appointment page. I also integrated the MySQL database to hold information about the appointments, but I had not set it up to hold user information for this enhancement. So at this point, the application still had hardcoded
  login information and the sign up page was not functional yet. I also had incorporated Spring Boot to turn my existing Java code into a RESTful API. I had to alter many aspects of the original code to make this succesfull. However, the 
  main logic of the original AppointmentService was still the basis of my backend code.
