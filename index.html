<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Hello! My name is John Schmidt and I began attending SNHU for a degree in computer science about two and a half years ago. In this course, CS-499, the core objective was to demonstrate our
  growth by improving on older projects that we had created in previous classes while learning more about the software engineering field. The goal of these improvements are to showcase our 
  abilities in three key areas; software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. In this self-assessment, I will explain my selection of artifacts, the improvements
  that I made to them, the other steps along the way, and what I have learned beyond the artifacts from my programs at SNHU.
